						Everyone my age remembers where they were and what they
						were doing when they first heard about the contest. I was sitting in 
						my hideout watching cartoons when the news bulletin broke in on my 
						video feed, announcing that James Halliday had died during the night.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'd heard of Halliday, of course. Everyone had. He was the videogame 
						designer responsible for creating the OASIS, a massively multiplayer 
						on-line game that had gradually evolved into the globally networked 
						virtual reality most of humanity now used on a daily basis. The 
						unprecedented success of the OASIS had made Halliday one of the 
						wealthiest people in the world.
					</p>
					<p>
						At first, I couldn't understand why the media was making such a big 
						deal of the billionaire's death. After all, the people of Planet 
						Earth had other concerns. The ongoing energy crisis. Catastrophic 
						climate change. Widespread famine, poverty, and disease. Half a 
						dozen wars.

						You know: "dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!"
						Normally, the news-feeds didn't interrupt everyone's interactive 
						sitcoms and soap operas un-less something really major had happened.
						Like the outbreak of some new killer virus, or another major city 
						vanishing in a mushroom cloud. Big stuff like that. As famous as he 
						was, Halliday's death should have warranted only a brief segment 
						on the evening news, so the unwashed masses could shake their heads
						in envy when the newscasters announced the ob-scenely large amount 
						of money that would be doled out to the rich man's heirs.
					</p>
					<p>
						But that was the rub. James Halliday had no heirs.
					</p>
					<p>
						He had died a sixty-seven-year-old bachelor, with no living relatives 
						and, by most accounts, without a single friend. He'd spent the last 
						fifteen years of his life in self-imposed isolation, during which 
						time if the rumors were to be believed he'd gone completely insane.
